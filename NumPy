This project relies on NumPy, the essential library for numerical computing in Python. Below, you'll find a brief overview of NumPy's core features and its role in our project.

What is NumPy?
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a powerful library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It forms the foundation for numerical computing in Python and is widely used in scientific research, data analysis, and machine learning.

Key Features
N-Dimensional Arrays: NumPy introduces the ndarray object, which is a fast, flexible container for large datasets. These arrays can be multi-dimensional and support a range of operations that are more efficient than traditional Python lists.

Mathematical Operations: With an extensive library of mathematical functions, NumPy enables efficient operations on arrays, including linear algebra, statistical analysis, and Fourier transforms.

Broadcasting: This feature allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes without requiring explicit looping, making the code more readable and efficient.

Interoperability: NumPy works seamlessly with other libraries like SciPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, forming a powerful toolkit for data science and machine learning.

Performance: NumPy is implemented in C, which means it offers performance close to that of compiled languages, making it suitable for large-scale computations.

Getting Started
To use NumPy in this project, you'll need to install it. You can do so via pip:

--pip install numpy
